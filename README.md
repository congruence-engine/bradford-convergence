# Bradford convergence

## Short summary
In the final year of the project we were seeking to focus our attention on enacting the national collection social machine in Bradford. We were looking to pay particular attention to the infrastructural set up of the social machine - how the technical set up and social relationships enable researchers, institutions and interested parties to make connections between collections and undertake new inquiries. This was trialled by organising 6 workshops with partners in Bradford. Most were organised in conjunction with one of the other investigations.

## Research questions:
Each of the Bradford Convergence workshops considered the research questions the project set around the social machine approach. We were interested what could be learned about them by bringing the Bradford social machine in contact with the CE social machine.

- What are the technical and social requirements for a social machine?
- What motivates participants in a social machine?
- What model of governance is useful for a social machine? What needs to be local, what central? Who holds centrally managed aspects?
- How do we negotiate diverse models of knowledge, expertise and linking?
- How do we not replicate oppressive structures, but set up models of reciprocal care?
